# get1c
A prototype script for downloading 1C distributives from users.v8.1c.ru

## usage

For now, separate distributives are downloaded with separate scritps. Run each script with the same syntax, for
example:

    get-client.sh <user_name> <password> <version>

where _<version>_ must be provided in the following format: __8.3.xx.yyyy__, where
__xx__ is a major version and __yyyy__ is a minor version.
